# ORM_e-commerce
  
    
  The purpose of this project is to create a back end for an e-commerce site. This project highlights how the MySQL database can interact with Sequelize and Express.js. The user is able to view and manipulate data, in this particular case Insomnia. Based on the routes and the particular data set that you would like to view you can create, read, update and delete certain information. 

  Here is a link to a demonstration of the application: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/7CfaBIRMdpq2D5hb22gE
